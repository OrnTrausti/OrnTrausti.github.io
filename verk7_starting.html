		<p>One of the great things about D&D is that you only really need a copy of the rules, some pencils and paper, a set of dice, and your imagination. Wizards of the Coast put a <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules">PDF of the basic rules</a> online for free because they “want to reduce the barrier to entry as much as possible,” according to communications director, Greg Tito. The pared down version of the ruleset cover the core mechanics and math of the game, a step-by-step character creation guide, and information on monsters.</p></div>
		<div>
		<p>The best place to start is with, well, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2IFN9xK">Starter Set</a>. The box includes everything you need to get started: an essential rules handbook, an introductory adventure </p></div>
		<div>
		<p>Players are sometimes disappointed that they don’t get to make their own characters, but trust me, all those pre-made character sheets do is get a bunch of math out of the way for you. The personality traits, motivations, and relationships listed on the sheets are meant to serve as inspiration, not hem you in.</p>

		<p>Of course if you really want to create a character from scratch, you can do that too. The website <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">D&D Beyond</a> offers a character creator tool that can help.</p></div>
		<div>
		<p>The hardcover <a href="https://amzn.to/2Kw76YO">Player’s Handbook</a>, which covers everything in the Basic Rules with additional character customization options and beautiful art, is good to have at the table to reference spells and abilities while you’re playing. The Dungeon Master can also pick up the <a href="https://amzn.to/2LntHYI">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>, which covers how to create memorable stories, and the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Lql140">Monster Manual</a> with stats for creatures to challenge your players.</p></div>
